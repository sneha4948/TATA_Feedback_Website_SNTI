# Introduction
This project, “Web Development Using MySQL DBMS, ASP.NET, and C# Framework” is a website development project that deals with the student feedback submission system for internships of Tata Steel (TATA PRASHIKSHAN). 

The project is in the form of a website where a user can login with their user ID and password present in the Tata Steel database and fill out their feedback through a form that is stored in the Tata Steel database, displaying a success message upon successfully submitting the form. 

This website  contains five web-pages: trainee-login, trainee-details, trainee-update-details, new trainee-registration and feedback page.
